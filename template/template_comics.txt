Theme: Awkward diplomacy of Taiwan
Description: In a bustling world map, Taiwan stands alone, surrounded by a sea of fallen dominos labeled with names of countries severing ties. A perplexed Taiwan holds a tiny glue bottle, trying to stick them back together. Nearby, a diplomat with a megaphone declares, "United in Isolation!" while juggling alliances like circus balls. Behind, a shadowy figure labeled "Geopolitical Puppeteer" pulls strings, laughing maniacally. Meanwhile, a group of bewildered penguins waddle by, holding signs saying, "Where's Taiwan?" A caption reads: "Global Diplomacy: A Comedy of Ironies."
